# Movie Database Udacity Project

This project was created for the Movie Database project at Udacity. The intended outcome of the project is to create a
functioning website that provides a movie database with images and trailers.

The project consists of three files:

* media.py - creates the movie class
* entertainment_center.py - creates movie instances of the movie class
* fresh_tomatoes.py - provided by Udacity to create the movie website

You can start the website by running the python script entertainment_center.py/
